## Other things to do in town
Notodden is small but super charming — especially on a Sunday when things slow down. Here are some fun things you can do:

### ⭐ 1. Heddal Stave Church

One of Norway’s largest and most beautiful stave churches.  
Open for visits, and the surrounding area is great for peaceful walks.  
There’s also a small visitor center and café.

---

### ⭐ 2. Walk along the river and Telemark Canal

The Notodden riverfront and nearby lake areas are beautiful.  
Grab a coffee and go for a relaxing walk, watch the boats, or have a picnic.

---

### ⭐ 3. Visit the Bok & Blueshuset

If open, this is a nice cultural spot with a library, cinema, and often small exhibitions.  
Great if the weather isn’t perfect.

---

### ⭐ 4. Hike to Tinnemyra or Ørvella

There are beautiful hiking trails close to town.  
Tinnemyra is a popular local spot — short hike, and you can walk around the water.

---

### ⭐ 5. If you’re into blues music history

Notodden is famous for the Notodden Blues Festival (if you’re there at the right time of year).  
Even off-season, you can check out small local displays or just soak up the bluesy vibe in town.

---

### ⭐ 6. Coffee & cake at a local café

Bok & Blueshuset café or Frukt & Tobakk are nice cozy spots to chill.  
Sundays are quiet, but it’s part of the charm!

---

### ⭐ 7. Visit Telemarksgalleriet (Art & Industrial Museum)

Often open on Sundays; check times.  
Cool mix of local art and industrial history — super fitting for Notodden’s history as a heavy industry town.

---

### ⭐ 8. Drive to Heddal Open Air Museum

Right near the stave church.  
Old Norwegian buildings, historical atmosphere, good for photos and relaxing.

---

### ⭐ Bonus idea:

End the day with a calm sauna or swim at Notodden swimming hall (if open) or just relax by the lake.
