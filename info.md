## Other things to do in town
Notodden is small but super charming ‚Äî especially on a Sunday when things slow down. Here are some fun things you can do:

### ‚≠ê 1. Heddal Stave Church

One of Norway‚Äôs largest and most beautiful stave churches.  
Open for visits, and the surrounding area is great for peaceful walks.  
There‚Äôs also a small visitor center and caf√©.

---

### ‚≠ê 2. Walk along the river and Telemark Canal

The Notodden riverfront and nearby lake areas are beautiful.  
Grab a coffee and go for a relaxing walk, watch the boats, or have a picnic.

---

### ‚≠ê 3. Visit the Bok & Blueshuset

If open, this is a nice cultural spot with a library, cinema, and often small exhibitions.  
Great if the weather isn‚Äôt perfect.

---

### ‚≠ê 4. Hike to Tinnemyra or √òrvella

There are beautiful hiking trails close to town.  
Tinnemyra is a popular local spot ‚Äî short hike, and you can walk around the water.

---

### ‚≠ê 5. If you‚Äôre into blues music history

Notodden is famous for the Notodden Blues Festival (if you‚Äôre there at the right time of year).  
Even off-season, you can check out small local displays or just soak up the bluesy vibe in town.

---

### ‚≠ê 6. Coffee & cake at a local caf√©

Bok & Blueshuset caf√© or Frukt & Tobakk are nice cozy spots to chill.  
Sundays are quiet, but it‚Äôs part of the charm!

---

### ‚≠ê 7. Visit Telemarksgalleriet (Art & Industrial Museum)

Often open on Sundays; check times.  
Cool mix of local art and industrial history ‚Äî super fitting for Notodden‚Äôs history as a heavy industry town.

---

### ‚≠ê 8. Drive to Heddal Open Air Museum

Right near the stave church.  
Old Norwegian buildings, historical atmosphere, good for photos and relaxing.

---

### ‚≠ê Bonus idea:

End the day with a calm sauna or swim at Notodden swimming hall (if open) or just relax by the lake.
